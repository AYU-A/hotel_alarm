Calling the hotel service.
At the entrance, we receive a request from the guest to Wake him up with a call at a certain time (10:00 am). Under following conditions:
- The call must occur with a minimum deviation from the set time. + / -1 minute is normal, 5 minutes is not allowed
- The call must only be received once
- The call must be accepted by all who requested it (there should be no passes)
- The service should continue to work normally if any server on which it is deployed fails.
